Spam Email Detection using Machine Learning
This project implements a machine learning model to classify emails as spam or not spam based on their content. The model helps in filtering out unwanted emails, improving email security and user experience.

Features
Dataset: Uses a labeled dataset containing spam and non-spam emails.

Preprocessing:

Removes special characters, stopwords, and punctuation.
Tokenization and vectorization (TF-IDF or CountVectorizer) for text processing.
Modeling: Implements classification models like Na√Øve Bayes, Logistic Regression, Random Forest, or SVM.
Evaluation: Performance is measured using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix.
Deployment: Can be integrated into email services for real-time spam detection.

Result
The model effectively detects spam emails with high accuracy. Performance metrics and visualizations are included in the notebook.
